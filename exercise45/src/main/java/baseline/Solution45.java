// For this program I opted to only use 1 class due to the fact that the program essentially does 3 things:
// Read all words from a file into a string, replace every instance of word1 with word2, and prints the new string into
// a new file. It would not make sense to have 3 classes each with one method.
package baseline;

public class Solution45 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a WordReplacer object.
        // Call retrieveInputFile(exercise45_input.txt).
        // Prompt the user to enter a file name and store it to a string.
            // Ensure that the user's input is not blank - If so, prompt the user again.
        // Call writeReplaceToFile("utilize", "use", file name).
    }
